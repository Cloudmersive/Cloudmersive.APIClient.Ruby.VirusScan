  # Scan an AWS S3 file for viruses
  # Scan the contents of a single AWS S3 file and its content for viruses. Leverage continuously updated signatures for millions of threats, and advanced high-performance scanning capabilities.  Over 17 million virus and malware signatures.  Continuous cloud-based updates.  Wide file format support including Office, PDF, HTML, Flash.  Zip support including .Zip, .Rar, .DMG, .Tar, and other archive formats.  Multi-threat scanning across viruses, malware, trojans, ransomware, and spyware.  High-speed in-memory scanning delivers subsecond typical response time.
